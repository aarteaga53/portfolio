                    I am a recent Computer Science graduate, looking forward to working in a new 
                    environment where I can apply my software engineering skills. By working in a new 
                    environment, I am hoping to gain new skills that can make me a better programmer. I 
                    am excited to work as part of a team where I can learn from different perspectives 
                    and work on meaningful projects.
